# Project-Drop

This project is a geocaching service with user-generated content.  Simply put, it's like carving your name into a tree, but digitally.  I had the idea to build it after reading an article about the Love Lock Bridgein Paris(http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/30/travel/paris-love-locks-bridges-feat/).  You see, they had started to remove locks from the bridge because it was getting too heavy.  We, as humans, had wanted to leave a trace, or footprint, in a place we had been, and it was starting to negatively affect the environment.

This got me thinking, there has to be a way to leave a mark on the map without damaging the environment, especially with today's technology.  So I have built this app for the people to use as a means to leave their 'mark on the map'.  It is different than other geocaching apps in the way that only people standing where you left your message can see it.

Technology used-
  -OAuth2 Authentication
  -JSON encoded server Interaction
  -Google Maps API
  -Volley/AsyncTask
