# Project-Drop

This project is a geocaching service with user-generated content.  Simply put, it's like carving your name into a tree, but digitally.  I had the idea to build it after reading an article about the Love Lock Bridge in Paris(http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/30/travel/paris-love-locks-bridges-feat/).  You see, they had started to remove locks from the bridge because it was getting too heavy.  We, as humans, had wanted to leave a trace, or footprint, in a place we had been, and it was starting to negatively affect the environment.

Here is what the map looks like right now, a very simple, intuitive setup to see what information has been 'left in the area' surrounding you.  You can only click on markers that are within 100m of your current location.

This here is a look at the way to see what information the Moment holds.  If the poster had decided to display their username, it would show instead of 'anonymous'.

And this here is the form to add a new Moment.  Right now you have the option to add it with either Public or Private tags(Private meaning only you can see your moment), and a choice of several different marker colors.

So I have built this app for the people to use as a means to leave their 'mark on the map'.  It is different than other geocaching apps in the way that only people standing where you left your message can see it.  Once I finish a couple of more things that are holding me back, I will upload the apk and install instructions.
